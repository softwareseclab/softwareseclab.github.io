👋🏻 Welcome to the ***Software Security Lab*** at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/)

<p>
    Our laboratory advances research in software security and cybersecurity.  
    We conduct theoretical and applied studies to address emerging threats in malware, non-executable document exploitation (e.g., PDF, Office, images), IoT and automotive systems, and AI-applied cybersecurity.  
    By integrating data-driven methods, modern machine and deep learning, and system-level analysis tools (e.g., dynamic instrumentation and sandboxing), we design and evaluate robust, scalable detection and mitigation techniques for real-world use.  
    Our work aims not only to contribute academically, but also to develop practical approaches for mitigating evolving cyber threats.
