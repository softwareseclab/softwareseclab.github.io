Welcome to the ***Software Security Lab*** at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/)

![](/assets/img/landing_img.png){: width="100%" height="auto"}

Our laboratory is dedicated to advancing the frontier of **software security and cybersecurity research**.  
We conduct both theoretical and applied research to address emerging threats in malware, non-executable file exploitation, IoT and automotive systems, and AI-driven security.  
By integrating **data-driven methodologies**, advanced **machine learning and deep learning models**, and practical **system-level analysis tools**, our mission is to provide **robust, scalable, and intelligent security solutions** that can be applied to real-world environments.  
Our research aims not only to contribute academically, but also to support the global community in mitigating evolving cyber threats.
