👋🏻 Welcome to the ***Software Security Lab*** at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/)

<p>
    Our laboratory is dedicated to advancing the frontier of software security and cybersecurity research.  
    We conduct both theoretical and applied research to address emerging threats in malware, non-executable file exploitation, IoT and automotive systems, and AI-driven security.  
    By integrating data-driven methodologies, advanced machine learning and deep learning models, and practical system-level analysis tools, our mission is to provide robust, scalable, and intelligent security solutions that can be applied to real-world environments.  
    Our research aims not only to contribute academically, but also to support the global community in mitigating evolving cyber threats.
