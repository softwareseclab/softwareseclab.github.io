### ***Our Research Areas***
---

#### `Malware Analysis & Binary Analysis & Non-executable File Analysis`
- Perform static and dynamic analysis of **executable binaries (e.g., EXE, ELF)** and **non-executable files (e.g., PDF, MS Office, image files)**
- Apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to extract effective features and enhance detection performance
- Use tools such as IDA Pro, Cuckoo Sandbox, PIN tool, and PDF analyzers for in-depth behavioral and structural analysis

#### `AI-applied Cyber Security`
- Develop malware detection and classification models using supervised and unsupervised learning
- Combine symbolic execution with reinforcement learning to discover vulnerabilities and automate analysis
- Explore multi-modal neural networks and graph-based models for Android malware and advanced threats

#### `IoT Security & Firmware Vulnerability Analysis`
- Analyze IoT firmware using static analysis, symbolic execution, and vulnerability scanning
- Perform fuzz testing to uncover security flaws in embedded systems and connected devices
- Research secure update mechanisms and protection techniques for IoT environments

#### `Mobility & Automotive Security`
- Develop anomaly detection systems for in-vehicle networks (e.g., CAN protocol) using AI techniques
- Investigate attack surfaces and countermeasures in automotive security
- Design intrusion detection and mitigation frameworks for connected vehicle environments
